from sangitha to everyone:
Postman is built in elctronjs
Request Types :
1.    Get
2.    Post
3.    Delete
4.    Put
5.    Patch
There are 4 different types of parameters 
1.    Request param
2.    Query param
3.    Form param
4.    Path param
Headers are of 2 types
1.    Content type – format of request to be sent to server
2.    Accept – format of response received from server
Chaining is a process of running a set of requests with data parameterization. Data from one response will be sent as the input to the next set of requests. These can be achieved using the variables in Postman
Variables – 5 different
1.    Global  - common data that can be used across collections
2.    Collection – specific to that collection including all folders and requests
3.    Environment – parameterized for any request [ dev, qa, uat, staging,etc]
4.    Local – applicable to a particular request
5.    Data – from external system (csv, JSON)
Newman is used to run the requests from command line instead of opening and running Postman

eaders are info sent to the requester
Content-Type --> contains --> content information for the request sent
Accept --> to force the response with the particular content type info
12-Apr:
Variable and Chaining
Variabes:
Global        - Common data to be shared across all the collections    
Collection    - Common data to be shared across all the folders and or requests within this Collection    
Environment    - Parametrized for any requests (like local env, dev, QA, UAT - e.g. the diff env will have diff server)
Local - only for that req...cannot be used to exchange info
Data        - Data from external files like csv, json
https://{{server}}/api/now/table/{{table_name}}
Pre-request script -> similar to @BeforeMethod annotation
Tests script --> similar to @AfterMethod annotation
Postman has inbuilt js library
eg. --> pm.response.json()
GET response gives many records ---> use Array of JS to pick one
resp.result[0].sys_id;
resp.result.count
NewMan - cmdln --> built on NodeJS

Oauth - open source authenictaion system.
     Oauth key or token is provided to access application.
Data perameterisation: can be done via Postam Runner and Newman
    json file or csv file are used
Newman cmd : newman run coll.json -g globals.json -d data.csv or data.json 
Here -d stands for data 
Visualisation : graphical representaion 
pm.visualiser.set(template,{repsonse:pm.response.json});
Here template is to be given to visualise the response. It can be done using :
let template = {{#each resp.result    
        <p>{{@key}}</p?
        {{/each}} --> this gets each key from response and visuaiilse
